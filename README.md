The following are included in this git repository.

1. Vivado Project file(s) and all the source files prepared for the simulation (i.e. slow clock for simulation) in a zipped folder.

2. Generated bitstream(s) (with proper slow clock set to a reasonable phase) One with Minimum resource implementation, and one optional with additional features/functionalities and improvements

3. A text file with any specific instructions for the practical operation of the machine, allocated reset button, LED signal/Seven segment display mapping and expected behavior of the circuit.

4. Final report
Include (but not limit to) a short description of the task, design diagrams etc,. simulation and testing methodology and results, strategies used to optimize resource consumption, resource utilization reports and any implemented additional features etc,. Also report individual contributions.
